# Assignment-9-

Assignment
1. Connect your previous node assignment to this assignment. Create a login
page. Use usernames and passwords created in last assignment to login
successfully. You donâ€™t have to create new user and password(sign up page).
You can manually enter the data in backend and verify that with frontend(i.e.,
Just create login page). Follow REST API folder hierarchy (Server.js should be
entry, router.js, controller.js, service.js, model.js). Refer the folder structure in
attached images.
2. Create 4 pages using react components and react-router (Home, About-us,
Jobs, Contact) as shown in the lab. Make sure to follow separate folder
structure for every component.
3. Add a card component on each page giving detail about each page. (Similar to
the"complex_component_single.htm" example shown in the class and in
folder react scripts uploaded in files). Use react map() to create dynamic
component at least on one of the page.
4. Feel free to use CSS and some additional text to make pages pretty.
5. Upload the assignment on git. Add Readme and gitignore(add node modules
in gitignore) and explain the assignment in readme properly. If readme and
gitignore is missing points will be deducted.
